# Analysis and Data Mining of a Medical Database.
My university project focuses on extracting valuable insights from a medical database using two powerful techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. PCA helps us identify patterns and reduce the dimensionality of the data, making it easier to understand and visualize complex relationships among medical variables. K-means clustering further enhances our analysis by grouping similar medical records together, allowing us to uncover meaningful clusters or subgroups within the patient population. By applying these techniques, we aim to improve medical decision-making processes and provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals

 Project Objectives and Implementation Protocol

The objective of this project is to apply data analysis and mining methods to help doctors in their decision-making process. A medical database (`cancer_des_poumons.csv`) is provided to detect anomalies.

# Project Description

## 3.1 Data Preparation

## 3.2 Feature Extraction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) will be used to extract new factors and reduce dimensionality for better data representation.

## 3.3 Data Mining
Clustering methods, such as K-means and Hierarchical Clustering, will be applied to distinguish between healthy and sick patients.
