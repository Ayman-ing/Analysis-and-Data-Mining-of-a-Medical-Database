# Analysis-and-Data-Mining-of-a-Medical-Database.-
Our university project focuses on extracting valuable insights from a medical database using two powerful techniques: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-means clustering. PCA helps us identify patterns and reduce the dimensionality of the data, making it easier to understand and visualize complex relationships among medical variables. K-means clustering further enhances our analysis by grouping similar medical records together, allowing us to uncover meaningful clusters or subgroups within the patient population. By applying these techniques, we aim to improve medical decision-making processes and provide valuable insights for healthcare professionals
